    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

An answer of 1 indicates this crisis exposed a significant weakness and a 5 indicates a significant strength was exposed.</value>

This portion of the website hosts Human Performance Institute surveys designed to compile information about you or someone you know for use in our administration of various health and wellness courses. Although your participation in the surveys is voluntary, their completion helps us to optimize our delivery of the courses to you or to the person about whom you are responding in the survey. Although the surveys are hosted and compiled, and the resultant E-mails sent by Performance Programs, Inc., a third party service provider, the pages you visit on the website and resultant E-mails are governed by this Privacy Statement.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By using portions of the website governed by this Privacy Statement, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement. Specifically, you consent to the collection, processing, retention, and disclosure of information you provide for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.

Some areas of this website may require you to submit information in order for you or someone you know to benefit from Human Performance Institute courses or to participate in a particular activity. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Our Use of Information that You Provide; Disclosure to Third Parties&lt;/b&gt;
